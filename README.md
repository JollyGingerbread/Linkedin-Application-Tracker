# Linkedin Application Tracker
Track which job offers you already applied to on external pages via [Tampermonkey](http://www.tampermonkey.net/), which is a browser addon that modifies websites in your browser.

1. Install Tampermonkey
2. Install this userscript
3. Go to the job search page and click on one of the jobs
4. When you click the apply button, it will remember the job id (it will not work if you don't click on any job posting first)
5. Jobs you already applied to will have a red title from now on
